### Hi there 👋 I'm Rajesh !!

<h2 align="center"> 👨‍💻 Whoami</h2>
<p align="center">
  <samp>Thank you for taking the time to view my profile.I believe in practical implementation rather than just reading on how to make things work.
  I am an experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the Information Technology and Services industry. Skilled in Oracle Database, SQL, JAVA, and PLSQL.
  With an interest in Artificial Intelligence and its applications in the real world, I started pursuing a master's degree in this domain. I have sound knowledge in developing algorithms for Computer Vision applications like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Learning concepts. I have strong practical knowledge in frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras and looking for a full-time opportunity in this field.
